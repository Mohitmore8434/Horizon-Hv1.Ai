## 🛠️ Hardware Engineering & Design Artifacts

### 1. 6-Layer PCB Stackup Architecture

To manage signal integrity for high-speed buses and prevent cross-talk between RF circuits and the AI accelerator, the board is designed on an advanced 6-layer stackup in **Altium Designer**:

* **Layer 1 (Top Signal):** High-speed differential pairs, RF routing, critical control lines.
* **Layer 2 (GND Plane):** Solid reference ground plane for impedance control and clean return paths.
* **Layer 3 (Inner Signal 1):** Low-speed peripheral buses (SPI, I2C, UART) and GPIO routing.
* **Layer 4 (Power Plane 1):** Split power planes (3.3V, 1.8V core, peripheral rails).
* **Layer 5 (GND Plane 2):** Secondary ground shield isolating power from bottom signal traces.
* **Layer 6 (Bottom Signal):** Power distribution traces, test points, secondary passives.
